            Dubai city is the capital of Dubai Emirate, an absolute monarchy and
            one of the seven emirates which constitute the UAE. Dubai is a city
            of skyscrapers, ports, and beaches, where big business takes place
            alongside sun-seeking tourism. The city is a major trade and
            transportation hub in the Persian Gulf region. Because of its large
            expatriate population, it feels like a Middle Eastern melting pot,
            and the atmosphere is generally tolerant. Religious affiliations are
            not a prominent aspect of city life. Islam is the majority religion,
            but churches and Hindu temples coexist with Dubai’s mosques.

            special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. It is famous for the
            Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and a sprawling metropolis of Classical
            architecture. But the city is known for more than its ancient
            history: it is home to the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain,
            incredible food, gardens and art, and a world-famous film industry.
